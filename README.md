# thinkboi-tweeter-node
This is a webpage frontend for a node.js implementation of thinkboi tweeter, that is, a client for sending tweets of length < 140 characters from one's
web browser through a private server. 

This version contains no functionality beyond the webpage frontend

TODO:
- implement saving drafts
- implement viewing drafts
- finish tweet length counter

- add node.js interaction with twitter api:
  intended to work whenever the script is running; when the server is not running, the user can save the drafts in a file
